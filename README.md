<h1>Analysing Trading Behaviour</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>

This project focuses on analysing trading behaviour using real-world trade data to uncover insights into user activity, trading patterns, profit/loss trends, and risk-taking behaviour. The aim is to convert raw trading data into meaningful insights through data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques. The analysis helps in understanding the decision-making process of traders and identifying strategies that lead to consistent profitability.

<h2>Objectives</h2>

-Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing and inconsistent values.

-Explore trading data to understand performance trends and trader behaviour.

-Visualize key metrics such as trade volume, profit/loss distribution, and price fluctuations.

-Apply analytical models to detect anomalies and behavioural patterns.

-Generate insights and recommendations to improve trading decisions.

<h2>Tools & Technologies Used</h2>

-Programming Language: Python

-Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

-IDE/Platform: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

-Version Control: Git & GitHub

<h2>Workflow Summary</h2>

-Data collection and cleaning

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization

-Feature engineering and transformation

-Model building, training, and evaluation

-Insights generation and reporting

<h2>Results and Insights</h2>

The analysis identified key factors influencing trading success, such as average execution price, trade size, and profit/loss ratio. Visualization dashboards provided a clear view of trading frequency, total returns, and market trends. These findings can support traders and analysts in developing more data-driven strategies and improving overall performance.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

This project demonstrates how data analytics can be applied to financial trading behaviour to reveal actionable insights. By leveraging Python-based tools and visualization techniques, complex trading data was transformed into understandable patterns. The study highlights the importance of analytical thinking in financial decision-making and provides a foundation for further exploration using advanced machine learning models.
